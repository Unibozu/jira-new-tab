# JIRA - Open external links in a new tab

Numerous users have requested this feature for JIRA but it has not - yet - landed on JIRA Cloud (https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-9380)

This is a tiny Chrome extension (less than 30 lines of code) to enable this behaviour - feedback welcome!

**Features**

* JIRA Cloud (*.atlassian.net)
* Opens external links in a new tab
* Internal links between Atlassian products should not be affected
* Ignores `mailto:` links
